Version Control
revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
stakes with files can easily be rectified.
A Local VCS  stores changes to files.
CVCS This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions.
more control over divvying up revision privileges.
for dvcs not very clear for me,
Snapshots -stores a reference to it
Local Operations -working on project anyway !
every change track by git
installing github for desktop...
