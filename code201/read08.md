Screen Sizes : Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show 
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to 
work on a range of different sized screens.

Screen Resolution : Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some 
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most 
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens

Page Sizes : Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web 
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 
since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens
