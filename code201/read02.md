Duckett JS book: 
Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions”
WHAT IS A VARIABLE? A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
var quantiy; 
quantity = 3;
VALU ES IN ARRAYS
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero not one
EXPRESSIONS An expression evaluates into results in a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
OPERATORS Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
ARITHMETI C OPERATORS  JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class. 
STRING OPERATOR There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
